NAME
    RT::Extension::Nginx - optimized request tracker within minutes

SYNOPSIS
        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make install

        cd /opt/rt4/local/plugins/RT-Extension-Nginx/
        ./sbin/rt-generate-nginx-conf
        ./sbin/rt-nginx-control start

DESCRIPTION
    This is beta software. Lacks some documentation.

    Extension comes with two scripts:

    rt-generate-nginx-conf
        Generates optimized nginx config from RT configuration and
        templates. Creates required directories and files.

    rt-nginx-control
        Simple script that can start, stop and restart nginx and fcgi
        processes. Run without arguments to see help.

FEATURES
  Fast web server in front
    Nginx is very fast web server with low memory footprint.

  Reverse proxy like setup
    Two servers schema with web server in front and FastCGI (FCGI) server
    running RT as backend. Nginx buffers replies from FCGI, so heavy FCGI
    processes get free and ready to serve next request before user gets the
    current request.

  Forking FCGI
    FCGI processes are forked so share some memory between processes
    lowering memory footprint.

  Serving images without FCGI
    Nginx serves /NoAuth/images/ location from files without touching FCGI
    and does it properly accounting local directory and plugins'
    directories.

  Semi-static serving of css and js
    Files served from /NoAuth/css/ and /NoAuth/js/ locations are stored on
    first request for re-use.

  Content gziping
    Html, css and js gzipped. For example size of the primary css file drops
    from 78k down to 19kb.

  TODO
    A few things can be improved within RT and this extension, but it's a
    good start.
